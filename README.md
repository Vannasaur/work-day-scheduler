# Work Day Scheduler - Module 5 Challenge

## Description

This Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am-5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This app also uses the Day.js library to work with date and time. Please see User Story and Acceptance Criteria below: 

User Story: 

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the Work Day Scheduler, click on the time block you would like to add an event or appointment to. You will be able to type whatever you like inside of the time block. Once you are finished, click on the save icon next to the time block you just updated. Anything that has been saved will be stored in your local storage until manually deleted. If you refresh the page, the saved input will still be available to you and will be shown within the corresponding time block. 

The time blocks are color coded to represent the current hour, the hours that have passed and upcoming hours from 9am until 5pm. 

The current date and time will be viewable at the top of the page. Upon page refresh, the date and time will update.
